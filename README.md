#BlackJack Project
This program was created to take the card game BlackJack and turn it into a running Java program. 

# Description
The purpose of the program is to be able to allow the user to hit or stand just like the card game and being
able to logically add cards from the 52 deck and remove cards as the game continues. 

When the program begins, player is automatically dealt two cards from the deck. Dealer also gets two cards but 
printed on the screen, there is also hidden card which player can not see. The program also adds the total of 
the cards and is presented on the screen. 

Player then decides to either hit or stand. When player decides to hit then the program will add another card. 
The total is displayed for user. If it’s more than 21 they lose, it it’s less than 21 they are welcomed to 
stand or hit again. 

Once player decides to stand, then dealer will take a turn next. Much like the card game, if either go over 21 
then the opposing team will win automatically. The dealer however will stand if total is more than or equal to 
17. Otherwise it will continue to hit. 

The game ends as the winner is displayed and the user is then asked if they would like to play again and then the program loops back again.

# What I learned 

The concept I grew more familiarized with it is calling the methods from each class/subclass and making it all 
work together. 

I had issues first calling methods and I would get an error and I pondered a lot why it was coming up like 
that. I then realized I needed to pass in the correct parameters so that the program is able to compile and 
not have anything issues. 

I believe what also helped in my logic process is writing it out. I decided to go write it out step by step on 
how the game is played, that way when developing the program on main I already had the blueprint to make it 
that just needed to be translated into Java program.
